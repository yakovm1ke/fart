1. Open the application and insert 2+ users (2 is minimum), between whom all calculations will take place.
2. Press `Let's fart` button to open list of purchases with only empty purchase.
3. You can insert name and price of product.
4. After that you can select users who are involved in this specific purchase by clicking the name tags bellow the price. `The cost per person will be calculated immediately`.
5. Also you can add new purchase by clicking `Add purchase` button.
6. When you finish adding purchases you may try to press the `Show details` button in the right block of the screen (or in the bottom bar if you use the mobile version of an app). This button will display the list of users with their purchases sorted by descending of the price.
